title: GraphQL Mesh Documentation
description: Versioned documentation republished from the GraphQL Mesh documentation site (under the MIT license).
---

The documentation in this folder was originally published at https://www.graphql-mesh.com/docs/. We are republishing it here because Adobe Graph uses an older version of GraphQL Mesh and the documentation at that site reflects the current version. Additionally, we currently only support a limited set of handlers, transforms, and recipes.
