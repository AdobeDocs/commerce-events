# Getting started

This guide provides you with the basic steps you need to set up your API management environment:

## Join the Beta

Request access to join the Adobe Graph Beta:

<!-- Nishant can you provide info regarding Beta signup? -->

-  An Adobe IO account. If you do not already have an Adobe IO account, [install Adobe IO].

## Prerequisites

Before you can begin using Adobe Graph, you must install:

-  [Node.js]
-  [nvm] 16.x.x

You will also need to have:

-  A working instance of Adobe Commerce with Live Search with either Luma or Venia sample data
-  An API key (provided by Adobe)
-  An API to integrate (for example, your own API, any public OpenAPI REST endpoint, or an [Adobe Experience Manager API])

## Configure your environment

Once you have an Adobe IO account you need to access the cli tool to start configuring your APIs with the schema management service.

1. Install the [schema management plugin] in your project directory:

   ```bash
   aio plugins:install @magento/aio-cli-plugin-commerce-admin
   ```

1. Create a `config.json` file in your working directory with the following parameters:

   ``` json
   {
      "baseUrl": "https://<your_commerce_site>",
      "authorizationToken": "<assigned_token>",
      "apiKey": "<your_apiKey>"
   }
   ```

1. Run the following command to load the configuration information into Adobe Graph:

   ``` bash
   aio config:set aio-cli-plugin-commerce-admin <path_to_json_file>
   ```

   **Example**

   ``` bash
   aio config:set aio-cli-plugin-commerce-admin ./config.json
   ```

## Next steps

-  Proceed to [create a tenant].
