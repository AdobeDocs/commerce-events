# Adobe Commerce Extensibility

Learn how to use the Adobe infrastructure to create extensions for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source.

*  [App Builder](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/overview/) is a complete framework that enables enterprise developers to build and deploy custom web applications that extend Adobe Experience Cloud solutions and run on Adobe infrastructure.

*  [Adobe I/O Events for Adobe Commerce](./events/index.md) makes all Commerce transactional data available to App Builder using Adobe I/O. Once the data is available in I/O, developers can use App Builder to build extensions and run custom integrations with third-party applications.

*  [API Mesh for Adobe Developer App Builder](https://developer.adobe.com/graphql-mesh-gateway/) allows developers to configure multiple APIs and other sources and serve them through a single GraphQL gateway.
